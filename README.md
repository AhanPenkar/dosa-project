# dosa-project
A small project assessing what the right kind of Dosa Batter is and what to do with it.

## Aim
I was looking to introduce and demistify the dosa for many people. People believe the crispy rice pancake has a lot to with technique and is all about the chef. While they are partially right, it also has a lot to do with the contents of the batter, which is made by grinding rice down with lentils.

## Database
The Data is originally sourced from this paper: https://www.proquest.com/docview/2560244203?pq-origsite=summon&parentSessionId=2d9mtZg54ufZjxSThp2LeO4HkvTdToz9cxQTBkLAECM%3D
That is a tax filing that reveals the exact proportions of ingredients with a widely sold batter. I chose the dosa and idly mix variants for this analysis. The Idli Mixes are in Idli.csv and the Dosa Mixes are in Dosa.csv.

Within the csvs, i've put all the lentil variants into one column to make it pop out more, having too many columns was distracting for the reader, and was unnecessary for the scope of this project. 

## Lessons
While I made a listicle and inference, I was considering experimenting with a subjective and artistic bar graph about sourness and softness for the Breakfast columns. I could have pushed the boundaries a bit more, but my creativity let me down.
